            <p>To my Favorite Person</p>
            <p>I know we didn't plan on doing gifts this year, but I couldn't let Valentine's Day pass without telling you how much I appreciate you.
                 You’ve been such a constant light in my life, and honestly, having you as a friend is the best gift I could ask for.</p>
            <p>They say Valentine's is for romance, but I think it's for the people we love most and that’s you. 
                I’m so lucky to have a friend like you in my corner.</p>
            <p>Sincerely yours, <br> Onu</p>
